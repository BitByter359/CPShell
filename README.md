# CPShell
CPShell is a Command Prompt Shell for Microsoft Windows XP and above. You deserve choice!

# NOTES
If you are trying to install this on a version of windows earlier than XP, don't.
We only support Windows XP and above.
(P.S, Windows 2000 Kinda works, but it won't kill explorer.exe, therefore making it
rendered useless.)

If the explorer shows on logon, check that CPShell copied to the startup folder!
If not, copy it yourself (from CPShellFiles in this folder, copy CPShell.bat to the startup folder.)

Explorer will show for a short period of time on logon depending on your computer speed.

Excuse me for my messy code in some places.

# DEVELOPERS
